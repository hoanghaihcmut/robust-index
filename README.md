## Abstract

A robustly quasiconvex function on a nonempty convex subset \$\mathcal{D}\$ of \$\mathbb{R}^n\$ is a quasiconvex function that remains quasiconvex under small linear perturbations on \$\mathcal{D}\$. The robustness index of the function on \$\mathcal{D}\$ is defined as the supremum of norms of these linear perturbations. In this article, we prove the set of the above linear perturbations is closed. Some algorithms for approximating the computation of the robustness index of quasiconvex functions on a subset \$\mathcal{D}\$ of \$\mathbb{R}^n\$ are presented, where \$\mathcal{D}\$ is nonempty, convex, and compact. Moreover, some numerical examples of finding the robustness index for some quasiconvex functions and an application of the robustness index in healthcare are given.
